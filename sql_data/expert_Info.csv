My main expertise is in Project Management & Training. I have a track record of over 100 projects completion (for over 300 million Euro); 12 projects rescued (for over 30 million Euro); and over 62 million Euro of acquired ones; over 250 projects worth several hundred million Euro assessed for several funding agencies; strong connection with industry and academia (over 140 industrial partners; 70 universities/research centres and 20 cultural institutions) and a professional network over 19K strong.
I have been operating and researching in Information and Communication Technology; Software Engineering; Automation & Robotics; Internet-of-Things; Security; Bioengineering; Workflow Management & Optimisation; Project Management; Quality Assurance & Compliance; Operation Management; Logistics & Supply Chain Management; Innovation Management; Research Management; Organisation (Re)Structuring; Business Process (Re)Engineering; Sustainability; Circular Economy; Publishing & New Media; Content Management; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Transfer & Training; Learning Content Management; Learning Platforms; Virtual Learning Environments; eLearning; Teaching & Training support tools
Research Interest & Plans - The current areas of research focus are Project Management; Problem solving; Complex Systems Modelling; with particular attention to Business Incubation and Acceleration; and Sustainability (especially in terms of circular economy and products end-of-life). Past research that I would like to readdress encompasses Automation (IoT); Industry 4.0; Physical and Logical Security; Data Protection; Knowledge transfer from the Military domain to the Civilian one. 
First of all; I intend to push forward my current research on sustainability; circular economy and innovation; including the aspects of business innovation/acceleration in these areas and at their interconnection.
I also intend to work on the possibilities offered by contact less technologies for the authentication and provision of services as well as the opportunities to extend and exploit systems already in place in industrial and commercial places to enhance security and safety as well as to empower better management of the site logistics using sensing and actuating devices in combination with IoT. The usage of RFID and NFC technologies could be used for providing new customersÃ experience as well as for monitoring and tracking in specific context where this is beneficial and allowed. 
Furthermore; IÃm interested in pushing forwards the research that IÃve carried out in relation to the usage of RFID technologies in museums for the full integration of security; asset management and visitor experience. I am looking to the next 20 years as my research horizon in which I would like to achieve some major result in this domain proving that technology; culture and social sciences can profitably work together to significantly enhance the quality of life of everyone around the world as well as support and promote economic growth.
Vision for an Informatics in Computing Program Development - I strongly believe that education is at the basis of socio-economic as well as human development. What we learn has to become part of our self; help us shape us as individuals; citizens and contributors to the development of culture and the society. IÃve been deeply involved in the IEEE-ACM joint definition of a world-wide accredited undergraduate curriculum for SW engineering and believe that the approach adopted for achieving such endeavour is potentially the best way forward for establishing a new education programme. IÃm well aware that the pace of evolution in the domain is fast and therefore it will be difficult to keep the mapping of the knowledge domain up-to-date; at the same time IÃm also deeply convinced that the related challenge should not be sufficient to discourage from taking up the endeavour. I believe in teamwork and multi-disciplinary and IÃm a strong supporter of the need for professionals working with software at all levels to gain a good systemic view and a basic understanding of other disciplines they have to cooperate with. If appointed I will engage in the development of a programme that will be based on the mapping of the present knowledge in the domain. The snapshot of the knowledge base will have to be developed in cooperation with other colleagues and professionals so as to be as accurate as possible; depending on the required delivery time-frame the course will then be developed by mapping available content and complemented with ad-hoc prepared content where available one will not be sufficient. Cooperation with IEEE and ACM will be sought after hopefully leading to an experience similar to the one of the Graduate Software Engineering Reference Curriculum [GSwERC].",

manufacturing process; to the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials
Solidification and microstructural evolution of metallic materials
Lightweight structures from design to manufacturing
Recycling of aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys
The focus of my research is on lightweight alloy materials and structures with the overarching goal
to advance the state-of-the-art in innovative materials and manufacturing methods in association
with the understanding of the mechanical behaviours and strengthening mechanisms of metallic
materials. I have successfully applied innovative material design and metallurgical processes for
developing aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys for casting manufacturing; in particular die
casting technology (high pressure die casting; low pressure die casting and gravity casting). My
research has developed a new dimension in the deployment of advanced materials such as high
strength and ductile aluminium alloys for cast structural components with YS>300MPa and El>10%;
high strength as-cast aluminium alloys to replace A380 type alloy with 30% increase of yield strength;
high temperature aluminium alloys for cylinder head of IC engine working at >200C; high temperature
magnesium alloys for piston of small IC engines working >300C; high thermal conductivity
(>125W/m.K) magnesium alloys for heat sinks. With emphasis of industry-oriented research; several
alloys and components have been successfully developed for massive production in the companies
in UK and Europe with proper IP licencing. Recently; hybrid structures including cast components
and wrought components have been success in automotive applications.","Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (No. PR069032) UK; 06/2014.

Xiaolei Liu; Yu Feng; Hongtao Cui; Fangyang Liu; Xiaojing Hao; Gavin Conibeer; David B.
Mitzi; and Martin Green; The current status and future prospects of kesterite solar cells:
a brief review. Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications; 2016; DOI:
10.1002/pip.2741. (JIF:6.456 Ranking 10/97 (10%); 38/295 (13%); 18/146 (12%))
Highlights:
A new carbon intermediate layer at the CZTS/Mo interface is reported.
The low temperature post-annealing treatment to reduce the concentration of
CuZn and ZnCu anti-site defects is reviewed.
The incorporation of Ge may provide a means to reduce the detrimental SnZn
defect concentration and improve the kesterite crystal quality; leading to a
decreased Voc deficit.
Both sodium/potassium and oxygen treatment are found to play a significant
role in the passivation of the grain boundaries of the kesterite absorber and at
the kesterite absorber/buffer layer interface.
A number of alternative buffer layer materials have been explored; including
ZnS; ZnO; (Zn; Mg)O; Zn(Se;O)and In2S3.
The oxygenated CdS (CdS:O) buffer layer is proposed as an area of future
exploration.

131110. (JIF:3.495 Ranking 29/146 (20%))
Highlights:
The RTA treatment facilitates Na diffusion into the CZTS absorber and improves
the crystallinity of Mo films.
The improved Na diffusion leads to smoother surface of the CZTS absorber;
which reduces the voids at the CZTS/CdS interface and cracks in the ZnO window
layer. Consequently; the series resistance decreases and the shunt resistance
increases.
The greater Na diffusion passivates the grain boundaries effectively and reduces
the recombination; which results in improved Voc.
The RTA treatment boosts the open circuit voltage; short circuit current; fill
factor and efficiency significantly.

Highlights:
A ZnO intermediate layer deposited at the CZTS absorber and the Mo back
contact interface dramatically reduces the voids; SnS2 in the CZTS sub-surface
region and the MoS2 thickness.
The ZnO intermediate layer enhances the carrier collection efficiency.
The ZnO intermediate layer reduces the series resistance and increases the
shunt resistance.
The ZnO intermediate layer significantly boosts the efficiency from 1.13% to
4.3%.

measurement; light and dark I-V; and Suns-Voc; are implemented to investigate
the fundamental properties of a Cu2ZnSnS4 solar cell.
The chemical distribution across the CZTS grain boundaries; the surface
potential of CZTS absorber; the minority lifetime; the carrier collection length;
diode ideality factor; dark saturation current and series resistance are revealed
in the characterization measurement.
The short minority lifetime; high defect density and large series resistance are
confirmed and need to be addressed in the future work for further efficiency
improvement.

2006 ALTRAN Foundation for Innovations Awards Submitted project on active control turbocharger was shortlisted along with 5 other projects from a total of 80 initial project submissions but did not win. The position it achieved; however; secured continuing support from ALTRAN of France and secured further commercialisation support.
2006 Royal Academy of Engineering; RAEng ERA Foundation Award Submitted the project on active control turbocharger for assessment and was borderline failure but received high praise; urged to continue development and to apply again as the failure in this case was the result of not having a achieved a commercially advanced level of engagement.

Showed how non-parallel flow effects re-distribute the œtwo-peak” asymptotic structure of the GreenÃs function in the acoustic analogy approach so that a heated supersonic flow is quieter than an isothermal flow (with A. Sescu; Mississippi State University).
Developed a mathematical model for the distortion of free-stream turbulence for flat-plate boundary layer with streamwise pressure gradients (with X. Wu; Imperial College).
Showed how negative correlation in upstream turbulence affects the low frequency roll-off of the jet-surface interaction noise spectrum.
Performed RANS-based Rapid-distortion theory calculations as part of a jet-surface interaction modeling (with S. J. Leib & R. Bozak; NASA Glenn Research Center.
Developed a generic algebraic turbulence model to represent the upstream boundary condition in Rapid-distortion theory problems (with M. E Goldstein & S. J. Leib; NASA Glenn Research Center.
Developed a trailing noise model based on Rapid distortion theory (with M. E. Goldstein & S. J. Leib; NASA Glenn Research Center.
Extended the Rapid-distortion theory of Goldstein (1979) to compressible transversely sheared mean flows (with M. E. Goldstein & S. J. Leib; NASA Glenn Research Center).
Showed that non-parallel flow introduces a œtwo-peak” spatial structure in the GreenÃs function for predicting the low frequency jet noise in isothermal air jets (with M. E. Goldstein; NASA Glenn Research Center & A. Sescu; University of Toledo).
Showed how statistical axi-symmetric model of the Reynolds stress auto-covariance tensor generalizes spherical shell turbulence models to cylindrical shells (journal paper 6) and thereby generalizes the two-source paradigm of jet noise in isothermal flows. Validated against LES & PIV.
Proved that the enthalpy flux/momentum flux coupling term will introduce a cancellation effect property in the formula for the acoustic spectrum of heated jets at supersonic speeds (with M. E. Goldstein & A Fagan; NASA Glenn Research Center).
Used Matched Asymptotic Expansions to prove that certain components of the propagator in the formula for the acoustic spectrum of cold jets can attain higher acoustic efficiency at low frequencies (as Goldstein 1975 showed could exist) whilst other components dominate at higher frequencies. Also proved that previously proposed models of the instantaneous isotropy of the Reynolds stress do not recover this low frequency property.
Showed how Large Eddy Simulations (LES) can be used to inform jet noise models could be used in jet noise modeling (with S. A. Karabasov et al.; Cambridge University).
Derived conservation equations to compute pressure-like adjoint GreenÃs function in parallel shear flow for jet noise prediction. These equations allowed computation of the GreenÃs function without need to differentiate the mean flow profile.

very much consider transferring our team to live and work in China. I currently lead a
team of 5 researchers in the general area of Asymptotic analysis and CFD with
application to Acoustics; Fluid Dynamics and Turbulence at the University of
Strathclyde. In addition; we have a Business/Human resources manager and a
Business/research proposals officer for our group both of whom are working on a
pro-bono basis at this time.
Prior to my appointment at Strathclyde; I was a Chapman Fellow and Laminar Flow
Control Research Associate at the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College
London. I collaborated here with the eminent Applied Mathematician; Professor
Xuesong Wu. Before that; I worked at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland;
Ohio; under various Fellowships including the NASA Post-doctoral Program; Center
for Turbulence Research & the David Crighton Fellowships from the DAMTP
(Cambridge) and Stanford University respectively. I hold a PhD in Engineering
(Mathematical modelling of jet aero- acoustics) from Cambridge University and a
high First class degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Bristol. At
NASA; I worked with the eminent Fluid Dynamicists; Drs Marvin Goldstein (former
Chief Scientist) and Stewart Leib on various aspects of applied mathematical
modelling for aero-acoustics and turbulence theory.
My group at Strathclyde includes 5 outstanding research scholars. The lead co-PI
(Kokkinakis) is an expert in Computational Fluid Dynamics and numerical modelling.
We; currently; have 2 PhD students and a Chinese student who will start his PhD in
the next summer and will conduct a research internship with us from July 2020. Last
year our group published about 10 journal papers (including at the prestigious
Journal of Fluid Mechanics; Physics of Fluids and the Royal Society of London) as well
as several in CFD based journals.
Taking our group to China (e.g. to Zhejiang University) would allow our research
productivity to increase by several folds simply because I see that Zhejiang; and China
in general; as a place where; above all; high-quality research matters. This type of
positive scientific environment would be the superb platform from which to develop
our research group even further from where it stands today. I believe that we would
be an ideal fit for your needs for many reasons including the fact that asymptotic
analysis; when coupled with CFD perfectly; bridges the gap between Engineering and
Applied Mathematics and Engineering/Applied Mathematical research is at the heart
of the work conducted in Engineering/Applied Mechanics Departments across China.
In addition; the two main research areas of our group (i.e. Acoustics and
Asymptotics) will enhance the already excellent research programs across the
academic community in China; especially when this is coupled with CFD and
developed in the form of a series of research projects and teaching modules. Hence;
bringing our group to China would be a perfect opportunity to develop these areas.
We hope that our experience in CFD; theoretical Fluid dynamics and Applied
Mathematics also will hopefully add to the excellent world-leading profile of
research present in the Fluid dynamics community in China.",
